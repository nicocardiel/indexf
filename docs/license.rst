This software was created by N. Cardiel as part of a collaboration aiming to derive the empirical calibration of the near-infrared Ca II triplet (:cite:`Cenarro2001a`, :cite:`Cenarro2001b`, :cite:`Cenarro2002`, :cite:`Vazdekis2003`). The program is an upgraded version (written in ``C++``) of a similar program (**index**, written in ``FORTRAN``) belonging to the ``REDUCEME`` package.

The software is released under the GPL version 3.
